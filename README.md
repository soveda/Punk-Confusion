# Punk Confusion

A split-brain punk card for the Music Thing Modular Workshop Computer.

`Switch Up` is the word "punk" taken literally: a voltage-controlled
Atari Punk Console-inspired synth voice. `Switch Middle` is Broken Venue, a
dirty room and damaged PA treatment for external audio. `Switch Down` and
`Pulse In 2` fire short venue-linked vocal calls through the same room engine.

## Quick Start

1. Flash `uf2/punk_confusion.uf2`.
2. Patch `Audio Out 1` to your mixer. Patch `Audio Out 2` as well for stereo
   room output in Broken Venue mode.
3. For APC mode, set the switch Up and turn `Main` up.
4. For Broken Venue, patch audio to `Audio In 1`, set the switch Middle, set
   `Main`, `X`, and `Y` near noon, then choose a room with `X`.
5. Hold the switch Down, or patch gates to `Pulse In 2`, to inject the current
   venue's vocal call.

## Modes

### Switch Up: Atari Punk Console

This is a simple dual-555-style APC model rather than an audio effect.

- `Main`: APC output volume.
- `X`: trigger oscillator rate, like APC pot 1. Clockwise is faster.
- `Y`: monostable one-shot time, like APC pot 2. The useful direction is
  matched to the tested hardware feel.
- `CV In 1`: adds to `X`.
- `CV In 2`: adds to `Y`.
- `Pulse In 1`: hard gate when patched. Unpatched, the APC free-runs.
- `Audio Out 1` and `Audio Out 2`: mirrored APC output.

`X` clocks the astable trigger oscillator. `Y` sets the one-shot length. When
the one-shot is still high, incoming triggers are ignored, giving the classic
skipped, stepped APC behaviour.

### Switch Middle: Broken Venue

Broken Venue processes external audio from `Audio In 1` through a fixed 50/50
dry/wet dirty-room engine.

- `Main`: input/room gain with soft pickup. Below noon attenuates hot modular
  signals, noon is about unity, and clockwise boosts quieter headphone or
  line-level sources. Hot Eurorack-level signals may clip above roughly
  2 o'clock.
- `X`: venue selection in room-length order.
- `Y`: audience absorption. Clockwise means more bodies in the room, reducing
  reflected energy and lightly damping the dry side so the 50/50 mix still
  reads as a room change.
- `Audio Out 1`: main processed output.
- `Audio Out 2`: decorrelated stereo room output.

The `Y` curve is inspired by Rummler/Green/Jurkiewicz/Kahle, "Forget About The
Seat Dip Effect" (Forum Acusticum / Euronoise 2025). The firmware uses a cheap
three-band approximation: small low-frequency loss, stronger attenuation around
`400 Hz-3 kHz`, and moderate high-frequency damping.

### Venue Order

`X` selects snapped venue zones:

| X range | Venue | Character |
|---|---|---|
| `0-1023` | `Marquee` | tight, sharp, short, metallic comb bite |
| `1024-2047` | `CBGB` | cramped, abrasive, short slapback |
| `2048-3071` | `100 Club` | denser, darker, warmer low-mid room |
| `3072-4095` | `Whisky a Go Go` | larger, brighter, splashier stage PA with mild comb bite |

These are not acoustic models of the real rooms. They are four punk-venue
personalities built from one compact delay, reflection, saturation, and
filtering engine.

### Switch Down: Vocal Calls

`Switch Down` is a momentary performance layer, not a separate full mode.

- Pressing or holding Down triggers the vocal call for the currently selected
  venue.
- Releasing Down stops playback, so you can stutter the call manually.
- `Pulse In 2` mirrors this behaviour: high gates the call, rising edges
  retrigger it, and low stops it.
- Driving `Pulse In 2` at audio rate can chop the shout into a raw vocal
  texture. That is intentional.
- `Audio In 2` is an experimental vocal slice/reverse CV input in this branch.
  When patched, positive voltage selects a later start slice for the next
  trigger; negative voltage selects a slice and plays it backwards. Unpatched,
  calls play normally from the start.
- The vocal is routed through the same Broken Venue path and gets an extra send
  into the room delay so it sits inside the venue.

`Audio In 2` is sampled only when the vocal is triggered. It does not scrub an
already-playing shout.

| `Audio In 2` voltage | Slice behaviour |
|---|---|
| Unpatched | Normal forward playback from the start |
| Near 0 V | Forward slice 0, starts at 0% |
| Positive CV, low to high | Forward slices 0-7, starting at 0%, 12.5%, 25%, 37.5%, 50%, 62.5%, 75%, and 87.5% |
| Negative CV, low to high magnitude | Reverse slices 0-7, starting around 12.5%, 25%, 37.5%, 50%, 62.5%, 75%, 87.5%, and near the end |

The Computer audio inputs clip at about `+/-6 V`. Hotter control signals, such
as a full-range Workshop System Slopes output, are safe but do not give extra
slice range: high positive voltages hold the last forward slice, and high
negative voltages hold the last reverse slice.

While holding Down, `Main` edits the saved vocal-call trim rather than the main
room input gain. The trim has soft pickup and is multiplied by the saved room
gain, so later input-gain changes still scale the shout level. The default trim
is midpoint.

## Vocal Samples

The embedded calls are original recordings by Adrian Vos, processed for Punk
Confusion as 24 kHz mono signed 16-bit PCM and kept around `-6 dBFS` peak to
avoid extra digital clipping after the Colourbox drive.

| Venue | Sample |
|---|---|
| `Marquee` | `Oi` |
| `CBGB` | `Hey Ho` |
| `100 Club` | `No Future` |
| `Whisky a Go Go` | `Let's Go` |

The source WAVs are kept in `samples/`, matching the organisation used by other
sample-based releases in this repo. Punk Confusion does not load samples onto an
already-flashed card; instead, custom calls are compiled into a new UF2. This
keeps the firmware simple, reliable, and self-contained.

To build with your own calls, replace the four WAVs in `samples/`, keeping the
same filenames:

- `marquee_oi.wav`
- `cbgb_hey_ho.wav`
- `club100_no_future.wav`
- `whisky_lets_go.wav`

Then run:

```sh
python3 tools/generate_vocal_samples.py
```

This regenerates `VocalSamples.h`, which is compiled directly into the firmware.
Keep replacement samples mono, 16-bit PCM, 24 kHz, short, and conservatively
levelled. The card targets a 2 MB program card, so all samples and firmware must
fit in flash.

### Local Web UF2 Builder

The easiest way to make a custom sample build is the local web builder. It gives
you a browser page for preparing the samples, then builds a complete UF2 on your
own computer.

First, open a command line app and move into the folder where you saved or
cloned `Punk Confusion`. The folder path will be different on each computer, so
use the examples below as a guide and change the path to match your own setup.

On macOS, open `Terminal` and use a command like this:

```sh
cd "$HOME/GitHub/Punk Confusion"
```

On Windows, open `PowerShell` and use a command like this:

```powershell
cd "$HOME\Documents\GitHub\Punk Confusion"
```

On Linux, open `Terminal` and use a command like this:

```sh
cd "$HOME/GitHub/Punk Confusion"
```

When the command line is in the `Punk Confusion` folder, start the builder:

```sh
make webui
```

Leave that command line window open. It is running the local builder.

Then open this address in your web browser:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/web/
```

If your computer says `make` is not available, use this command instead:

```sh
python3 tools/web_uf2_server.py
```

Use the page like this:

1. Drop one audio file into each venue slot.
2. Wait for each slot to say `ready`.
3. Use the preview player to check the converted shout.
4. Check that total sample time and estimated header size look sensible.
5. Press `Build custom UF2`.
6. Wait for the local CMake build to finish.
7. The browser downloads `punk_confusion_custom.uf2`.

The browser converts each source file to mono 24 kHz signed 16-bit PCM and
normalises it to about `-6 dBFS`. The local builder receives those processed
WAVs, regenerates `VocalSamples.h`, runs the firmware build, and returns the
finished UF2. The first build may take longer if the Pico SDK has to be fetched.

The local build process replaces the four files in `samples/` and regenerates
`VocalSamples.h` before compiling. Commit or copy any sample set you want to
keep before running the builder with different sounds.

The original included shouts are backed up in `factory-samples/`. After making
a custom UF2, restore the factory samples and matching header with:

```sh
make restore-factory-samples
```

You can use a different local port if needed:

```sh
make webui WEB_PORT=9000
```

If you do not want to build a UF2 straight away, the page can also download
processed WAVs or a replacement `VocalSamples.h`. The processed WAV download is
useful if you want to audition or archive the exact card-ready files before
building.

### Command-Line Build

For a command-line local build using the WAVs already in `samples/`, use:

```sh
make custom-uf2
```

That regenerates `VocalSamples.h`, configures/builds the Pico SDK project, and
writes `uf2/punk_confusion_custom.uf2`. To build from a separate folder of
card-ready WAVs, use:

```sh
python3 tools/build_custom_uf2.py --samples path/to/my-samples --clean
```

The sample folder must contain the four filenames listed above. From this
standalone repo, CMake uses the local `ComputerCard.h` and will use a local Pico
SDK if available, or fetch the SDK into the build directory.

## LED Map

- `LED 1`: APC mode indicator in Switch Up; venue-zone display in room mode.
- `LED 2`: Broken Venue / vocal mode indicator.
- `LED 3`: divided APC trigger-clock blink in Switch Up; venue-zone display in
  room mode.
- `LED 4`: vocal trigger / Switch Down flash.
- `LED 5`: APC gate-open indicator in Switch Up; venue-zone display in room
  mode.
- `LED 6`: clip / chaos indicator.

Middle-mode venue display on `LED 1` / `LED 3` / `LED 5`:

| Venue | LEDs |
|---|---|
| `Marquee` | `LED 1` |
| `CBGB` | `LED 3` |
| `100 Club` | `LED 5` |
| `Whisky a Go Go` | `LED 1 + LED 3 + LED 5` |

While Switch Down is held, `LED 1` / `LED 3` / `LED 5` temporarily become a three-step
meter for the saved vocal-call trim.

## Building

This release includes source, `CMakeLists.txt`, a local `ComputerCard.h`, the
generated `VocalSamples.h`, and the source WAVs used to generate it.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j2
```

The firmware uses `set_sys_clock_khz(192000, true)` and
`PICO_XOSC_STARTUP_DELAY_MULTIPLIER=64`. The build uses the default flash binary
type rather than `copy_to_ram`, because the embedded vocal PCM is too large for
a RAM-copy build.
